# Beaver

_A note-taking app for coders and mathematicians._

```text
Beaver is a work in progress.

It aspires to be a cross-platform (web, desktop, mobile) note editor
that can render Github-flavored markdown, LaTeX, and mermaid
diagrams.

Also, optional Vim-style key bindings.
And integration with Github for version control.
```

The dream is set, but the work has just begun.
